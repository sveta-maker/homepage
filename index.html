<p>mdash&; For me, wealth is a tool for achieving clearly defined goals. Your money should always work. It takes patience and enthusiasm to achieve your goals. Think big - but be realistic. Life is too short and work is too important to waste energy in an occupation that is neither enjoyable nor beneficial. <\p>
